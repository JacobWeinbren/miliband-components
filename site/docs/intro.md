**Miliband Components** is a component library design for the **Miliband Theme**. This project was made for [The Social Review](https://www.thesocialreview.co.uk/). 

Throughout development I have recieved much insight from friends, above is a poster for them, based on *Reasons To Be Cheerful*, a podcast by Ed Miliband. The favicon and logo are from [Ed Miliband For Leader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Miliband).

## Installation

To install dependencies and build the component library, first clone the repo. Then run the following

```bash
yarn install && yarn run build
```

## Docs

Docs are build in [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/), can be served on `localhost:3000`
