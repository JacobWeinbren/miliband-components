Built by [Jacob Weinbren](https://github.com/JacobWeinbren), and friends at [The Social Review](https://www.thesocialreview.co.uk/).

## Features

There are some really exciting aspects to building this as a component library:

-   Web components are part of the latest web standards, which is important for long-term use
-   Using polyfills means it is easier than ever to support this library for older browsers
-   Web components are framework agnostic, improving developer flexibility

## Testing

To make Miliband Components work in a wide range of uses, it uses the following tests:

-   Miliband Components aims for WCAG 2.1 Standards, and tests initially using [aXe](https://www.deque.com/axe/)
-   On completion, The Social Review aims to have an external assessment of accessibilty support
-   Miliband Components are tested for bugs all major browsers - Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge and Opera
