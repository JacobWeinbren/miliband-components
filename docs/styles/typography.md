## Font

Miliband Components uses [Fira Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fira+Sans#license). It is:

-   Free and open source
-   Easy to read
-   Casual, but also recognisable
-   Supported on a wider range of devices

### Font Types

This is how it looks to render bold and italics in the browser.
